Taurus
========================

The Taurus angular.js application allows to manage
a universal common interface for tipical bank transfers.

How it works
-------------

Secret Code:
Users get a secret code (tipically 6 digits code) from their Bank. This code will be a sort of password that
with email address will be the credential to obtain a transaction ID to begin the process payment. Users can
consume Taurus transactions only by smartphone. 

Transactions:
Transactions are execute under a secure protocol and operations are executed thanks to an auhorization code
sent to the user's smartphone by the system.

Commit:
All operations are syncronized with user's bank systems. The operation can be cancelled within eight hours.
The user's bank executes the order the next day only after checking the validity of the operation.

Installation
